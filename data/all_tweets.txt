ronald reagan &amp; USER are different men w/ different styles, but are fundamentally similar in their honesty, toughness &amp; optimism
.USER will nominate justices to the supreme court in the mold of the late justice antonin scalia
this election is not just about the next 4 years. it will determine the future of the supreme court for the next 40 years USER 
on his 1st day in office USER will repeal every job-killing executive order burdening our job creators USER 
.USER believes in the strength &amp; ingenuity of the american people &amp; will unleash the boundless potential of our economy
there are more than 7 million americans living in poverty today than when USER took office
the foreign policy record of this administration and USER has made america weaker. USER knows weakness arouses evil
like ronald reagan, USER knows that in order to have peace, america needs to be strong
our choice has never been more clear. we can either elect my running mate, a bold truth-teller, or the most dishonest candidate in history
like ronald reagan, USER has the toughness to rebuild our economy and command the respect of the world USER 
and the same belief in the greatness of this country and the same confidence in the boundless potential of the american people (2/2)
at the heart of donald's trump's campaign is the same impatience - the same dissatisfaction with the status quo (1/2)
like ronald reagan, donald trump has the honesty/bluntness to confront the challenges facing the american people from his 1st day in office
ronald reagan's example informed my entire political life and it forms it still to this day USER

it's been amateur hour on the world stage for the last 7 1/2 years and america, our allies and those who defend our freedom know it
despite traveling millions of miles as sos, the world is more dangerous today than the day USER &amp; USER took office
it's time to set the record straight. the leadership of USER &amp; USER has weakened america's place in the world

we can finally find a test other than istep that both parents and teachers can believe in.

anyone who knows the pences knows we're all about family.
john gregg called obamacare "good news" and a "game-changer."
my opponent's record is very different.
when i became governor i had a goal: have more hoosiers going to work than ever before. now, a record amount of hoosiers are going to work!
record investment from companies large and small, and in was rated in the top 5 states in america to do business.
we've invested billions in the crossroads of america, and were still able to pass the largest tax cut in indiana history.
now, we've balanced budgets, maintained strong reserves, and made historic investments in education.
we're going to make sure every hoosier knows john gregg's record before election day. a record of deficits, debt, and higher taxes.
hoosiers have a choice to make.
this is an exciting time to be a hoosier. indiana is on the move!

the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary - but also at many polling places - sad
we've all wondered how hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. wikileaks may have found the answer. obama! URL

they let crooked &amp; the gang off the hook for the crime, but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad. unbelievable! URL 
election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!

the very foul mouthed sen. john mccain begged for my support during his  primary (i gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
disloyal r's are far more difficult than crooked hillary. they come at you from all sides. they don‚Äôt know how to win - i will teach them!
with the exception of cheating bernie out of the nom the dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the republicans!
it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to.
our very weak and ineffective leader, paul ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.

my lawyers want to sue the failing USER so badly for irresponsible intent. i said no (for now), but they are watching. really disgusting
the failing USER has gone nuts that crooked hillary is doing so badly. they are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!
crazy maureen dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing USER , pretends she knows me well--wrong!
wacky USER , who hardly knows me, makes up things that i never said for her boring interviews and column. a neurotic dope!
.USER just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. boring anti-trump panelists, mostly losers in life!
i never met former defense secretary robert gates. he knows nothing about me. but look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!

the seriously failing USER , despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
hillary clinton just had her 47% moment. what a terrible thing she said about so many great americans!
while hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, i still respect them all!
really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad. lindsey graham, romney, flake, sass. supreme court, remember!
wow, hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. i think it will cost her at the polls!

hillary clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. she is totally confused. unfit to serve as #potus.

the polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
the great state of arizona, where i just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective senator, jeff flake. sad!
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as USER , if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
"USER : USER cnn is so biased. never ever watch them. trump 2016!!"
crooked hillary's v.p. pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea. a total lie - and taken over during o term!
wow, the failing USER has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release. they are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
.USER is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

president obama should have gone to louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. too little, too late!
hillary clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of the state department. lie!

certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the u.s.supreme court get proper appointments. sad!
"stay on message" is the chant. i always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd a, repeal ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
i have always been the same person-remain true to self.the media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
it is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
i am not only fighting crooked hillary, i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. people get it!
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media. she is not a talented person or politician. the dishonest media refuses to expose!
my rallies are not covered properly by the media. they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say, i would be beating hillary by 20%
the failing USER , which never spoke to me, keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change. false, i am who i am-never said
the failing USER talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. their reporting is fiction. the media protects hillary!

will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt hillary?
when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillary's pay-for-play at state department?
cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton.

so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine, they have already taken crimea and continue to push. that's what i said!
when i said in an interview that putin is "not going into ukraine, you can mark it down," i am saying if i am president. already in crimea!
this story is not about mr. khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather radical islamic terrorism and the u.s. get smart!
mr. khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over t.v. doing the same - nice!
wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. the failing USER is a joke. USER is laughable!
"USER :  without absolutely owning the liberal media, hillaryclinton wouldn't stand a chance. #voterfraud and #msm her only hope."
the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention. i wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h?
i was viciously attacked by mr. khan at the democratic convention. am i not allowed to respond? hillary voted for the iraq war, not me!
captain khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!

crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. a formula for disaster!

the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke. USER and the little watched USER = sad!
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world.
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street!
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no!
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough!
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition - sad!
funny how the failing USER is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said "trump is a genius." america 1st!

just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp.  URL 
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep?

you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis (a good thing). please get your facts straight - thanks. USER 
for the record, i have zero investments in russia.
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster, the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump. crazy!
dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

pocahontas bombed last night! sad to watch.
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. the republican convention was great
funny, if you listen to USER , the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two, they are fawning. what a difference
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! waste of time.
elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated!
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself.
i was at USER and met juan williams in passing.  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air!
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke!
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war.

the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change!
wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance!
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the dnc - they just got caught, that's all! they laughed at bernie.
if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
thank you! #makeamericagreatagain URL 
hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against bernie!
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis &amp; all others laughing!
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you!
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out!
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! e-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook!
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild
the USER panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. USER is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn!
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
today proves what i have always known, that USER priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (USER .)
sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect. sad!
there is no longer a bernie sanders "political revolution." he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates.
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite!
wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement! total disrespect
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h!

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart!
the wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me!
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs!
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer!
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back!
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta.
leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on-line from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her!
tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing!
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight?

i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, as her v.p. then we can litigate her fraud!
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. bernie said she has bad judgement!

sleepy eyes chuck todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n.c.
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a.c. others to follow. ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city.
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves - convention center, airport - and destroyed city
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.

crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
crooked hillary clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." not fit!
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement!
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with "murder." come november 8, she's out!
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support! win

fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security. no charges. wow! #riggedsystem
the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair! as usual, bad judgment.
it was great spending time with USER yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again!
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace!
on USER at 7:00 p.m. "special: meet the trumps" hope you enjoy!
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays?
with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - radical islam!
crooked hillary clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked!

crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis - it will just go on forever. we need change!
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this!
in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed!
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught!
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting "go away, no pictures."
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
"the system is rigged!"
on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know.
just watched USER and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good news-the people get it!
it was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged!
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong! what bill did was stupid!

bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.

the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again!
